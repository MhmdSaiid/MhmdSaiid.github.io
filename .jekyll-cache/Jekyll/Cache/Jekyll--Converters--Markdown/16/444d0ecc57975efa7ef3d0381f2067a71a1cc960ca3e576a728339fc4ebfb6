I"q<p>As of January 2023, I am a Machine Leartning Scientist at <a href="https://www.egencia.co.uk/en">Egencia</a>, an <a href="https://www.amexglobalbusinesstravel.com/">American Express Global Business Travel</a> company, working on enhancing recommender systems and applying Large Language Models on company use-cases.</p>

<p>Prior to that, I was a PhD student in the Data Science Department at <a href="https://www.eurecom.fr/en">EURECOM</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.eurecom.fr/~papotti/">Prof. Paolo Papotti</a>. My research focuses on using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to automate fact-checking. Specifically, I’m interested in fact-checking in natural language using structured data such as relational tables, and enhancing information extraction in pre-trained transformer-based models and their ‘reasoning’ capabilities.</p>
