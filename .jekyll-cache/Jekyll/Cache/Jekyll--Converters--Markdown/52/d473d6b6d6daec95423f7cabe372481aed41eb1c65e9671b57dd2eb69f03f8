I"9<p>As of October 2019, I am a PhD student in the Data Science Department at <a href="https://www.eurecom.fr/en">EURECOM</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.eurecom.fr/~papotti/">Prof. Paolo Papotti</a>.</p>

<p>My research focuses on using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to automate fact-checking. Specifically, I’m interested in fact-checking in natural language using structured data such as relational tables, and enhancing information extraction in pre-trained transformer-based models and their ‘reasoning’ capabilities.</p>
