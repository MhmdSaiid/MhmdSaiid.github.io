I am an [Apple](https://apple.com/) AIML Resident working on LLMs and morphologically complex languages. Prior to that, I was a Machine Learning Scientist at [Egencia](https://www.egencia.co.uk/en), an [American Express Global Business Travel](https://www.amexglobalbusinesstravel.com/) company, working on enhancing recommender systems and applying Large Language Models on company use-cases.

I did my PhD at [EURECOM](https://www.eurecom.fr/en), under the supervision of [Prof. Paolo Papotti](https://www.eurecom.fr/~papotti/). My research focuses on using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to automate fact-checking. Specifically, I'm interested in the intertwine between structured data (relational tables and knowledge graphs) and transformer-based language models.
