As of October 2019, I am a PhD student in the Data Science Department at [EURECOM](https://www.eurecom.fr/en), under the supervision of [Prof. Paolo Papotti](https://www.eurecom.fr/~papotti/). 

My research focuses on using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to automate fact-checking. Specifically, I'm interested in fact-checking in natural language using structured data such as relational tables, and enhancing information extraction in pre-trained transformer-based models and their 'reasoning' capabilities.
